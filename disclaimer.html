                    <h1>Referral Program</h1>
                    <p>Any accrued referral credit can only be used for, and will automatically be applied to the next recurring charge. Accrued referral credit cannot be redeemed for cash (or other) in any case, even if the customer discontinues their Service
                        prior to the renewal date and wishes to claim their unused credit. The Company reserves the right to discontinue the referral program, alter the reward structure, and revoke a customer’s referral credit at any time, without justification.</p>
                    <h1>Cancellation / Refund Policy</h1>
                    <p>Monthly and Yearly subscriptions are recurring until cancelled by the customer. You may cancel your recurring subscription for the Service at any time by visiting our website and signing into the User Account Dashboard and clicking
                        &quot;cancel subscription&quot;. Any applied coupons or discounts will expire prior to or upon cancellation depending on the coupon terms. If a coupon/discount has a finite redemption period, at the end of the redemption period
                        you will be charged the full price of the recurring subscription purchased on the following billing cycle. At the end of a free trial, you will be automatically charged for the purchased membership price. If you wish to cancel
                        before the free trial ends, visit our website and sign in to the User Account Dashboard and click “cancel subscription”. Billing cycle starts the day of purchase. Refunds cannot be given due to the fact that customers receive full
                        and immediate access to all resources upon purchasing. In order to not be charged on the next billing cycle, cancellations must be made before the renewal date. It is the responsibility of the customer to cancel his or her subscription
                        before the renewal date. For any issues cancelling your subscription please email us at future.elitesllc@gmail.com.</p>
